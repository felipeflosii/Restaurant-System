## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running

### Run with Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/felipeflosii/RestaurantSystem.git
cd RestaurantSystem
docker compose up --build
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:8080`. The PostgreSQL database is automatically provisioned by Docker Compose — no external database setup required.

### Run Locally (without Docker)
```bash
# Requires Java 21 and a running PostgreSQL instance
git clone https://github.com/felipeflosii/RestaurantSystem.git
cd RestaurantSystem
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

---

### Example Requests

**Create a restaurant:**
```json
POST /restaurants

{
  "name": "Bella Italia",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "specialty": "ITALIAN"
}
```

**Create a dish linked to a restaurant:**
```json
POST /restaurants/1/dishes

{
  "name": "Margherita Pizza",
  "description": "Classic tomato, mozzarella, and basil.",
  "category": "PIZZA",
  "price": 42.90
}
```

**Create an order:**
```json
POST /orders

{
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "dishIds": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

## Development Roadmap

### Level 1 — Foundation ✅
- [x] Basic CRUD for Restaurant, Dish, and Order
- [x] Auto-calculated order total from dish prices
- [x] Status automatically set to `CREATED` on order creation
- [x] DTOs with validation via `@Valid`
- [x] Global exception handler
- [x] Relationships: Restaurant → Dishes, Order → Dishes
- [x] PUT endpoints for Restaurant and Dish
- [x] Separate response DTOs from request DTOs
- [x] Negative price validation on Dish
- [x] Prevent ordering non-existent dishes
- [x] `POST /restaurants/{id}/dishes` and `GET /restaurants/{id}/dishes`
- [x] Docker + Docker Compose with PostgreSQL

### Level 2 — Business Logic
- [ ] `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps on Order
- [ ] `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` with forward-only status transition validation
- [ ] Custom `ResourceNotFoundException`
- [ ] Prevent deletion of restaurants with active orders
- [ ] `GET /orders?status=` filter by status
- [ ] `GET /dishes?category=` filter by category

### Level 3 — Production Ready
- [ ] Spring Security + JWT (login and registration)
- [ ] Protected routes
- [ ] Database migrations with Flyway
- [x] Dockerfile 
- [x] Docker Compose with app + database services 

### Future
- [ ] React frontend consuming the API
